# Tickerizer

Tickerizer is an open source developed and maintained by Cloud 66. While it is developed primarily to demonstrate [Cloud 66](https://www.cloud66.com/) Deployment tools for Rails, it can be used a stock price dashboard and hosted anywhere.

Tickerizer shows stock prices and updates them in real-time. By default, it uses fake data, but you can connect it to a free Vantage Alpha account for real data.
